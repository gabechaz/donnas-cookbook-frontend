Woke barbie game is a push your luck roll and move and write game about getting about getting a car,
finding a good boyfriend and making it to prom

The board consists of a town that your pawn will be traversing over the course of the game by rolling dice 

when you roll a die, you can either use the die result to advance or to take an action as proscirubed
on the dice. So there are six actions, one for each die

the six actions are as follows(subject to change)

1. work on car(must have car)

2. take a selfie

3. work day job

4. do homework

5. exercise

6. 


hold on, this has got me thinking. What if the spots on the board led to different decks. You can 
go either direction on the board, but the board spots are put on erratically so you're basically getting an 
two options every turn, (with some modifiers of course) you have say three or four decks that correspond
to different activities. When you land on a space you draw a card form the associated deck and take that action
As you take actions you affect what is inside your decks, so its like a multi tiered deck builder
where you slowly build out the decks of your character as well as getting things like cars and dresses
and improving the look of your character. Game ends at the prom with a score comparision of all players
who have made the requisite for making it to prom
